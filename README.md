# Bootstart #

Bootstart is a lightweight simple to use PHP MVC framework. The framework makes use of the Singleton and Registry design patterns.

## Installation ##

To use the framework you will need Apache or Nginx and PHP installed on your machine. Consider WAMP or XAMPP if you are using Windows.

Once the necessary software has been installed, download and paste the repository into your www/htdocs folder, inside your own folder() and open a browser. Navigate to http://localhost//public/. You should see a welcome screen.

## Routing ##

Routing is handled by the app/routes.php file.
